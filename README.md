----------

* dates with times&sdot;of&sdot;day and durations that understand nanoseconds
* timestamps with settable, zero-filling subsecond precision
* algorithms preserve temporal relationships and local precision

** the current time (according to the local host)
** UnivTime(), LocalTime() for universal mean time, local mean time
*** is_univtime(mytime), is_localtime(mytime)


- Times are moments of time: your clock and calendar
- Spans are measures in time: +(3 days), -(5 microseconds), +(1 week 2 days)

#### brings in Base.Dates

- interoperates with Date and DateTime, which are exported
- exports Base.Dates.Time as **Time24**, and interoperates
- interoperates with Base.Dates.Period types, which are exported

----

   &diamond; fully interoperable with DateTime, Date, Time24 types    
   &diamond; provides a clean, easy-to-understand functional interface    
   &diamond; enhances the ability to work with mixed time masures   
   &diamond; covers all levels of FINRA, MiFID II timestamping
   
>  The 2018 US, EU financial regulations governing timestamps require stamped times encode UTC Â±50 microseconds.
This package does not know whether a conforming time server is present.  The timestamps will be precise; where the time base is UTC traceable and stable,  the timestamps will comply with FINRA and MiFID II 2018 regulations.

| forms | access |
|------|-----|
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Year .. Nanosecond | the component itself |
| year .. nanosecond | the raw Int64 value above |
| Years .. Nanoseconds | this and coarser components in this form |
| years .. nanoseconds | the raw Int64 value above |

- The Year[s], Quarter[s], Month[s] forms are used with Times
- The Hour[s] .. Nanosecond[s] forms are used with Times and with Spans
- The Day and Days are synonyms, Week and Weeks are synonyms
